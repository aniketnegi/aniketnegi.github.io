THE SOUND OF SILENCE
- Aamna Abdin

===========

As the leaves of the tree rustle
  You hear a symphony.
A symphony of solace.

As the waves of the ocean rise
  They whisper to you in silence.
The sound of which was unheard amongst the clamours.

As the city noises run towards you
  You begin to search for tranquility within yourself.
You listen to your heartbeat,
  And, you find the repose you have always cast about.
