> I think the main reason people are feeling this way ^, about how everything was beautiful in the past - whether it be architecture, art, academics, engg. or anything else - is because we as a society have moved from working for passion to working for money. There are a number of reasons for that, but i'm not in the mood to delve into them right now. But yes, even in engineering colleges i've noticed, with the competitive exams, people who don't do well are "stuck" with "inferior" fields of study, which are not actually inferior, but just not what they want to study. so you get mechanical engineers who want to do cs. And CS too is so popular and exclusive because there is more demand because there is more money, again, people are taking CS because of money and not passion. So we are left with a workforce who is qualified, but not interested. The education system & the mindset behind gaining and providing education needs to be looked into, and a societal change is required. Otherwise we might fall short on the expectations of Science Fiction writers - more of "idiocracy" than "asimov".
